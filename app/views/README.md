# app/views

The app/views directory in this project does *not* contain view templates, but
instead contains view classes for the presentation logic needed to supply data
to Mustache templates.

These view classes should subclass the `Stache::Mustache::View` class.

For detailed information, see the
[Stache gem documentation](https://github.com/agoragames/stache).
