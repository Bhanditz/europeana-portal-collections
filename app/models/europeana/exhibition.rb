Their travels have often taken them beyond Europeâ€™s borders, into diverse cultures and communities. Drawing on the rich collection of the Finnish National Gallery and other archival sources, this exhibition traces the journeys of Finnish artists from the 1880s to the 1930s, across north Africa and the Middle East to New York and New Mexico.",
